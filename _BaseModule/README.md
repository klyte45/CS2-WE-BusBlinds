# Vanilla Bus Blinds - A module for Write Everywhere

This Write Everywhere module adds layouts that attach two blinds to vanilla buses, one ahead and another behind every model.

The content of the front blinds have source from the `GetTargetDestinationDynamic` builtin function from WE, that may be overridden by other transportation mod - Like [XTM](https://mods.paradoxplaza.com/mods/74238/Windows) will do in a near future.

The content of the back blinds have source from current route identifier/number, that already is customizable via XTM mod.

There are two font settings from this module: `FrontBlindFont` for front blinds and `BackBlindFont` for back blinds. You can configure the effective font to be used in both cases at the WE's window (tab Prefab Templates Setup).
